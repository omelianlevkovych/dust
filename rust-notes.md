# Prelude
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/prelude/index.html
`Prelude` is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program.
Prelude can be seen as pattern to make using multiple types more conviniently. So you will find other preludes
in the standard library, such as `std::io::prelude`.
